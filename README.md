An admin page used to populate client's data.

# Theme
The theme used in this project can be found on [github](https://github.com/mrholek/Clever-Bootstrap-4-Admin-Template-with-AngularJS-Angular-2-support)
You can take a look at how to use it's controls by cloning and building a local copy of the Angular2_CLI_Full_Project folder (just run npm install and ng serve after downloading it). 

Note that this is the angular 2 version of this theme, so in some cases the implementation you have to use may differ slightly.
